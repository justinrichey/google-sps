        <h2>Stuff I've Worked On</h2>
        <h3>Class Project: Build Your Own World</h3>
        <p>Created a randomly generated 2D tile-based world. 
            Implemented character movement and save/load features, 
            as well as a replay feature. Worked with a partner, 
            collaborated using git.</p>

        <h3>Class Project: Google Maps Clone</h3>
        <p>Using existing map API, implemented restaurant search
            capability. Also implemented A* algorithm to find the 
            directions of the shortest route between two restaurants.
        </p>

        <h3>Independent Project: Arcade Game</h3>
        <p> Created a mobile game called Fleety Feet with a group of friends, 
            where the objective is to dodge sliding objects. 
            Contains shop/point/progression system. First programming 
            project, created in high school with informal programming 
            knowledge.
            <br>
            Although the game was intended for mobile with up/down swipes,
            it's playable at this link with WASD on the keyboard:
